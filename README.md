# ship_game
A simple game made in pygame. You steer a spaceship and avoid the projectiles. The goal of the game is to earn as many points as you can without dying, the faster your ships goes the more points you get.
But be careful, the faster you go the faster the projectiles come at you!

# CONTROLS:

  - `AWSD` to move your space ship.
  - `4/num 4` to increase the speed of your spaceship.
  - `6/num 6` to decrease the speed of your spaceship.
  - `5/num 5` to stop your spaceship.
  - `r` to restart the game after dying.
  - `q` to quit the game.
  - `8/num 8` to change the direction of your ship.
